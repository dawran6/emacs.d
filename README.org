#+TITLE:Daw-Ran Liou's Emacs Configuration
#+STARTUP: overview
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :tangle init.el :results silent

This is an ongoing evolution of my original Emacs configuration files, inspired
by a bunch of resources Iâ€™ve found online:

- https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs
- https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org
- https://github.com/meqif/.emacs.d
- https://github.com/raxod502/radian/blob/develop/emacs/radian.el

* Startup performance

The startup time is ~0.5 seconds on my machine. I'm using a couple of techniques
from Doom. (See: [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly][How does Doom start up so quickly?]]) I also sets
=straight-check-for-modifications= to ='(check-on-save find-when-checking)= because
I don't usually tweak my dependencies often.

* Configuration structure

- =early-init.el= - see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html][The Early Init File]]
- =init.el= - main configuration
- =lisp/extras.el= - Credits to [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/wiki/Useful-Commands][selectrum's wiki]]

These are kept out of git's version control:

- =private.el= - The file is loaded after init.
- =custom.el= - The file is for the custom settings.
- =backups= - The folder is for backups.
- =auto-save-list= - The folder is for the auto save files.

* Mac (OSX) ergonomics keybindings

Several OSX native keybindings that utilizes the command key (which is also the
=super= key) are added to make context-switching to other native apps easier,
e.g. Chrome, Firefox.

- =s-t=: open scratch buffer
- =s-/=:: commenting line
- =s-'=: er/expand-region
- =s-\=: er/contract-region
- =s-p=: project-find-file
- =s-g=: magit-status
- =s-F=: rg-project

* Evil (Vim-style) keybindings

- https://github.com/noctuid/evil-guide
- https://nathantypanski.com/blog/2014-08-03-a-vim-like-emacs-config.html

This configuration uses [[https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][evil-mode]] for a Vi-like modal editing experience.
[[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] is used for easy keybinding configuration that integrates well with
which-key.  [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]] is used to automatically configure various Emacs
modes with Vi-like keybindings for evil-mode.

- =SPC w=: evil window map
- =SPC n j=: org-journal-open-current-journal-file
- =SPC n J=: org-journal-new-entry
- =SPC n f=: org-roam-find-file
- =SPC d=: dired-jump
- =SPC e=: eshell
- =SPC g g=: magit-status
- =SPC g b=: magit-blame-addition
- =SPC g d=: magit-diff-unstaged
- =SPC g f=: magit-file-dispatch
- =SPC g l=: magit-log-buffer-file
- =SPC t c=: display-time-world
- =SPC R=: elfeed

* Emacs-style keybindings

However, there are some cases where I prefer emacs style keybindings. I either
bind them to something else or just overrides them:

- Universal argument =C-u=: this is bound to =C-M-u= because I prefer =C-u= for
  scrolling.
- =C-e=: end-of-line
- =C-y=: yank
- =C-k=: kill-line
- =M-.=:: xref-find-definition
- =M-,=: xref-pop-marker-stack
- =C-x C-b=: ibuffer
- =C-M-j=: switch-to-buffer
- =M-:= : pp-eval-expression
- =M-/= : hippie-expand
- =M-o=: ace-window
- =C-M-,=: embark-act
- =C-h B=: embark-bindings
- =C-c C-d=: helpful-at-point
- =C-h C=: helpful-command
- =C-h F=: describe-face
- =C-x C-j=: dired-jump
- =C-M-'=: eshell-toggle
- =C-x g=: magit-status
- =C-c g=: magit-file-dispatch
- =M-y=: yank-pop+
- =C-x C-r=: recentf-open-files+
