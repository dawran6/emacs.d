#+TITLE: Sketch Themes

This is an ongoing evolution of my theme, inspired by a bunch of resources Iâ€™ve
found online:

- https://github.com/cryon/almost-mono-themes
- https://github.com/maio/eink-emacs
- https://lospec.com/palette-list/1bit-monitor-glow

I also shared some thoughts on syntax highlighting on my blog:
